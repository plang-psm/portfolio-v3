I've never been the greatest writer. It was something that I've struggled with which is why creating this blog is quite ironic. I often found myself struggling to write condensed summarizations but I found joy in the art of assembling it all together. It's probably the reason why I turn into a perfectionist when writing. 

<br/>
You'd think that maybe writing isn't for me after reading that first introduction but for some reason, I enjoy it. I've been searching for ways to incorporate it into my daily life and I think this might be the perfect place for it! I plan to discuss my story on breaking in tech, discussing any recent topics I have learned, and a full breakdown of the projects I've worked on.

<br/>
We'll start from there and see where this goes. Heres to a new beginning and hopefully some fulfilling and entertaining content!
