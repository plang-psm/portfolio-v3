<span style="color: #02ec88; font-weight: bold;">What is it:</span>

Mementos Photo Booth is a Latino owned photo booth rental company based out of Los Angeles. The company was seeking alternative ways to reach new customers as well as establish trust aside from social media. The owner decided that a website would be a great way to bridge that gap. You can find the 4 page site on
<span style="color: #02ec88; font-weight: lighter;">https://mementosla.vercel.app/</span>
 which includes a home, about, products and gallery page.
<br/>
<br/>

<span style="color: #02ec88; font-weight: bold;">How it was built:</span>

The website went through 4 different stages which included the project resources, design, implementation, and accommodation stage. Below you can find a sneak preview of each.

<br/>
**Project Resources:** During the project resources staged, we mapped out a general idea of what type of content we wanted on the website, how many pages, a general overview of a design, and the tools we need to consider using. Here we decided that a 4 page website that advertised, and informed the consumer about the company and its products would be best.

<br/>
For tools, we decided to use Next.js for its image optimizations feature, Tailwind.css for quick styling, Figma for its simple design creation, Framer Motion to bring the website to life and Chat GPT to create descriptions.

<br/>
<span style="color: #02ec88; font-weight: bold;">Other Considerations:</span>
CDN to speed up delivery of content – customer was not interested due to price.
Creating an admin dashboard – customer only interested in a static web page.

<br/>
**Design:** Figma was where most of the design process took place. There was a need to research basic design principles for a more detailed user experience. One of the principles being the 60-30-10 rule which is said to prevent overwhelming color combinations for users. Another strategic design method used was placing important content on the left side of the web page to ensure it catches the user attention as users usally read left to right. There were a few rerenders due to the flow of the limited resources which will be discussed below.

<br/>
<span style="color: #02ec88; font-weight: bold;">Struggles:</span>
**Content**: Due to the company being fairly new, we had very limited content to display on the website. The stakeholder preferred we use content from their events to fully display their products. This led to a delay in the project and caused rerenders as well.

<br/>
<span style="color: #02ec88; font-weight: bold;">In Result:</span>
The stakeholder was more than satisified with the website. They are currently using it for its intended use and plans to explore expanding the website down the road when the business grows.
